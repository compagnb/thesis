##Introduction

> “The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.” – Morpheus, The Matrix

We are constrained to the limitations of how our bodies interpret data. Our perception of reality is the result of our brain processing the environment around us. Data from the environment is observed through our senses,  or in computational terms “sensors”.   The data received from the environment then triggers a response from the brain to different parts of our body. Through the interaction with these “sensors,” experiences become a unique series of signals and chain reactions controlled by our nervous systems. These experiences become memories when data of the event is stored in the internal hard drive that is the human brain. These memories can be accessed in a variety of ways, including as the result similar interactions. By investigating our responses to environmental stimuli, as well as the biometric data created by the electrical and chemical reactions communicating these responses throughout the body from the brain, we are able to evaluate the data without influence. Hence by looking further into ourselves for data we can begin to break down signals and reactions; thus freeing our data from the interpretations that the mind constrains us to.

As we begin to explore tracking these interactions, we can utilize wearable technology that uses sensors to document biometric activity. Once again, we feel the constraints of data interpretation from companies pushing these products. Each snapshot of intimate communication within our bodies is documented through the sensor readings of wearable technologies. These processors present biological data to the subject through the perceptions and realities created by the goals of the companies. For example, a fitbit, marketed for weight loss, presentartics interactions through quantity steps and heart-rates throughout the day. Polar, marketed for heart monitoring during exercise, focuses on optimizing heart-rate to achieve a more substantial workout. Both of these companies push their own agenda in the communication of this data, but are the standards they set applicable to our own methodologies?

Imprisoned by these marketing agendas, data is exploited as these perceptions are shared or sold to other companies with ulterior motives (i.e. firms focusing on neurological marketing). This leads to the following questions: Who owns this data? How is it being used? And are we able to find our own truths within it?

This paper will explore how data is interpreted within the body as a series of intimate responses, in addition to the methods used by companies to project their agendas on customers. It will also attempt to address the bio-privacy issues mentioned above, encouraging an attempt to facilitate the emancipation of truths within biometric data for use in more personal methodologies.
