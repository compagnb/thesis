##2 DOMAINS & PRECEDENTS

**2.1 Processing Signals.** Signal processing begins with information from the environment activating a sensory receptor. These receptors are specialized cells in the human body with the ability, like computational sensor components, to aggregate data from physical changes, or stimuli from the environment. These stimuli can be both external and internal, meaning that the data can be acquired within or outside of the body or computational system. 
External stimuli encompass the five most commonly known senses: sensation/touch, vision, smell, taste, and sound. In addition to these traditional senses, equilibrium is also classified as an external stimulus. 
Each of these stimuli are experienced with different types of receptors or “components” within the sensory organ. Sensation utilizes receptors similar to “pressure sensors” on the skin to capture sensation data. These sensors capture the smallest effect of environment change, i.e. a fly gently landing on an arm, as well as much larger changes, i.e. an object piercing through the skin. Vision data is recorded by photoreceptors, which function similarly to “photo resistors”. These sensors capture the presence of light data or lack of light data that enters the retina. Odor data is captured through sensory cells in the nasal cavity called olfactory receptors. Taste data is recorded through epithelial cells, or taste buds. Both smell and taste sensors capture chemical reactions from environmental input such as food and perfume. Sound is recorded by sensors, which are able to sense changes in pressure caused by frequencies. 
Internal stimuli manage homeostatic, or the main driving forces, within the system. Sensors and receptors in various areas of the system monitor these stimuli and capture pressure, stretching, and chemical or temperature changes. Internal stimuli within a human body may include nutrient/ion levels in the blood, oxygen levels or water levels, while internal stimuli within a computational system may include battery power, processor temperature, etc. 
Once each of these sensors have recorded data supplied by the stimulus, both internal and external, the data is then interpreted into signals and transmitted to the central nervous system where the data is processed.

Deviations from an appropriate level motivate behavior to restore levels to its norm.  Behaviors include, but are not limited to, pain, thirst, fatigue or withdrawal. 

The first part of signal processing begins with information from the environment activating a receptor. Receptors are specialized cells within the human body, or components in computational terms. These components have the ability to aggregate data from physical changes around them, such as light, pressure, temperature, pain, etc.  

Signal processing begins with acquiring data through sensors. The human body has a multitude of senses that gather data from both internal and external stimuli. In addition to the traditional  

as will as a number of different receptors within the body. mm

Each of our senses or “sensors” gathers data from the environment and transmits this data to it’s respective partition of the brain for processing. 

Why do signals relay? (stimulus/command)
How are signals processed? (reaction/function)
What effects signal processing? (perception/visualization)
How do these events be stored/recalled? (memory)
What can signal relay within the human body tell us?
